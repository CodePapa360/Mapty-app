# Mapty App -- Map your workouts
I have finised building this Mapty after learning Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript from Jonas Schmedtmann's course.

- Ability to delete a workout (with marker on the map)

### Features might be added:
- Ability to edit a workout
- Ability to sort workouts by a certain field (e.g. distance)
- Re-build Running and Cycling objects coming from Local Storage
- More realistic error and confirmation messages
- Ability to position the map to show all workouts
- Ability to draw lines and shapes instead of just points [very hard]
- Geocode location from coordinates [asynchronous JavaScript]

JavaScript]
